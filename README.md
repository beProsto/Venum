# Venum 

## Introduction, skip this part if you are not intrested

"Venum" as i like to call it, is kind of a game engine. 
What I really think it is, is my take on learning OpenGL, in future Vulkan and DirectX.
I don't intend it to be a full-blown game engine. I want it to be an experimental thing, like my "programming playground". 
The name was suggested by my friend. I like it.

For creating windows, event handling and image loading I'm using SDL2. 
All the rest are graphical API's and (if) my physics engine.

## How to install, and use "Venum"

It's pretty easy. You just include all of these files in your code. 
But, before you do that, you will have to:

1) Include and link newest GLEW version in your project:
- http://glew.sourceforge.net/
3) Include newest GLM version in your project:
- https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html
2) Include and link SDL2 in your project:
- https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
3) Include and link SDL2_image in your project:
- https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
4) Include and link SDL2_mixer in your project (I will use it untill i'll learn OpenAL):
- https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/


That's pretty much everything. 


## How to learn "Venum"
 
Now. You can learn everything about venum from: 
- Examples (examples folder - I'm in the process of creating it)
- Reading the source 
- Reading documentation (it's my fav, and yes - I'm in the process of creating it)

### I'm reorganizing the project, so there will be a rly big update
