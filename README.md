# venum

// Introduction, skip this part if you are not intrested
So yeah, how to start it...
"venum" as i like to call it, is kind of a game engine. 
What I really think it is, is my take on learning OpenGL, in future Vulkan and DirectX.
I don't intend it to be a full-blown game engine. I want it to be an experimental thing, like my "programming playground". 
The name was suggested by my friend. I like it.

For creating windows and event handling I'm using SDL2. 
All the rest are graphical API's and ( if ) my physics engine.

I think I will create some sort of GUI for venum. 
I mean: Scene editors, Shader editors, etc..

// How to install, and use "venum"
It's pretty easy. You just include all of these files in your code. 
But, before you do that, you will have to:

1) Include and link newest GLEW version in your project:
- http://glew.sourceforge.net/
2) Include and link SDL2 in your project:
- https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

That's pretty much everything. 


// How to learn "venum"
Now. You can learn about everything about venum from: 
- Examples ( examples folder )
- Reading all the files
- Reading documentation ( it's my fav, and yes - I'm in the process of creating it xd )
